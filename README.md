# Stanford-Machine-Learning-Course-by-Andrew-NG
In this course, I learnt the fundamental concepts of Machine Learning. It includes a detailed mathematical implementation of various ML algorithms. As part of the coursework, I implemented Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, K-Mean Clustering, Anomaly Detection and Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Systems without using any existing libraries in Matlab. This helped me to get a clear understanding of the working of these algorithms and how the algorithms are efficiently implemented using vectorisation.
